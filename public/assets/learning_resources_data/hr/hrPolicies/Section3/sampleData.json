The Caelum Way performance evaluations are designed to be holistic, engaging, and supportive, ensuring that every employee not only meets but exceeds their potential. Research underscores the significance of structured performance evaluations: a study by Glassdoor (2020) reports that a well-structured onboarding and performance evaluation process can boost employee retention by 82% and productivity by over 70%. This section delves into best practices for conducting performance evaluations that are thought-provoking, comprehensive, and sensory-engaging, tailored to meet both the high standards of the ICSE framework and Caelum’s commitment to sustainability and employee well-being."
