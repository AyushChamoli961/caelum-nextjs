    "description": " Employee engagement and well-being are not just important—they are foundational to creating a thriving and productive work environment. Research shows that schools with high levels of employee engagement benefit from improved performance and a healthier school culture. According to a study published in the International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research, engaged teachers create better learning environments, leading to enhanced student outcomes and higher job fulfilment for educators themselves. A report by the Horton Group found that 93% of their employees engaged with well-being programs, significantly boosting organisational productivity. This synergy between engagement and well-being is at the heart of the Caelum Way, where the well-being of our people is seen as a key factor in the success of our school community. In this section, we will explore the strategies that Caelum implements to promote employee engagement and support well-being, emphasising the Caelum Way—our commitment to creating a work culture that nurtures the emotional, physical, and professional needs of every team member.\r\n"

Studies indicate that organisations with effective recognition programs see a 31% reduction in voluntary turnover (Work Institute, 2018). Our recognition efforts include formal accolades, peer-nominated awards, and even simple gestures of appreciation that help employees feel valued and celebrated."

We take this seriously, acting on survey results to continuously improve the employee experience."
