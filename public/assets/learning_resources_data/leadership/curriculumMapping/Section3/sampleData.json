          " In this section, we focus on a collaborative, hands-on activity that allows educators to explore and develop practical strategies for integrating the core principles of the Caelum Way into their teaching. The Caelum Way encourages educators to move beyond traditional approaches, fostering a learning environment that is not only academically rigorous but also emotionally supportive, interactive, and responsive to each child's unique needs and interests. Through this brainstorming session, teachers can generate a range of innovative activities that align with Caelum's values, supporting students' holistic growth and creating a foundation for lifelong learning.",
          "This activity allows educators to actively participate in defining how the Caelum Way principles—playful learning, collaboration, social-emotional growth, child-centredness, and real-world learning—can come to life in their classrooms. By working in teams, teachers can share perspectives, challenge one another's ideas, and develop meaningful practices that will make learning a more engaging, personalized journey for students"
