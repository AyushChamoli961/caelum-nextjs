          "In a rapidly evolving educational landscape, it is essential for teachers to continuously improve their practice. Professional development (PD) provides teachers with the tools, knowledge, and skills needed to enhance their teaching strategies, foster better student outcomes, and grow as educators. Caelum recognizes that for professional development to be meaningful and impactful, it must be purposeful and structured.",
          "A widely recognized method for setting effective goals is the SMART framework. SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This method ensures that goals are clear and attainable, providing a pathway for success while maintaining focus on desired outcomes. By adopting SMART goals, we not only align our professional development efforts with the needs of our teachers but also ensure that they are actionable and measurable.",
          "The process of creating SMART goals encourages thoughtful planning, ongoing reflection, and tangible progress. For our teaching staff, SMART goals provide a framework for setting objectives that are aligned with both personal aspirations and the school's broader mission.",
          "In this chapter, we introduce the SMART framework in the context of professional development, followed by a template that can be used to create clear, measurable, and time-sensitive development goals."

          "Achievable: The goal should be realistic, ensuring that it can be accomplished given the resources, time, and capabilities available. This involves making sure the goal is challenging, but not impossible to achieve.",
          "Relevant: The goal must matter to the broader objectives of the professional development program and be aligned with both the individual's professional aspirations and the school's mission.",
          "Time-bound: Every goal needs a target date for completion. Setting a deadline keeps the goal on track and encourages timely action."
