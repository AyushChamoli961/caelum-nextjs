The process helps identify strengths and areas for growth, ensuring that any staff development initiatives are aligned with both the school's educational philosophy and the individual aspirations of our teachers.",
          "To this end, we've designed a four-part framework for conducting a comprehensive needs assessment for educational needs.

Focus groups offer an opportunity for open dialogue, encouraging teachers to discuss their challenges, successes, and aspirations more freely. By facilitating group discussions, we can gather qualitative data that surveys might miss, such as emotional insights or shared experiences among teachers."
