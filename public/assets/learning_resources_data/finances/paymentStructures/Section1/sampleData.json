          "In any educational institution, one of the most critical factors influencing its success is the ability to attract and retain talented individuals. For a school that follows the Caelum Way, which is based on nurturing holistic development, recognising individual contributions, and providing a supportive and transparent working environment, establishing a fair and equitable payment structure is essential. This payment structure not only needs to support the school’s values and mission but also ensure compliance with the legal framework in which the institution operates. The Caelum Way envisions a compensation model that aligns closely with the institution’s core values, providing a competitive and comprehensive remuneration package while ensuring fairness for every employee.",
          "This chapter will guide you through the core principles that should underpin the compensation structure at a Caelum Way school, along with key considerations for creating a sustainable and legally compliant system. Additionally, it will provide an actionable template that school leaders can use to implement an effective payment structure that ensures fairness, equity, and alignment with the school's mission."

It is essential to ensure that the salary structure remains competitive with other schools in the region.
