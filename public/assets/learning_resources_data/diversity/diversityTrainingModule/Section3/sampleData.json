          "Creating a truly inclusive environment isn't just about celebrating diversity—it requires addressing the deeply ingrained perceptions and attitudes we carry, often unknowingly. These subtle perceptions, known as unconscious biases, shape our decisions, actions, and interactions in profound ways, even when we’re unaware of them.",
          "Research shows that over 90% of human brain activity occurs at the unconscious level, meaning many of our judgments and actions stem from automatic processes (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013). As educators and leaders, this hidden layer of bias can shape our behavior, our teaching, and how we interact with both students and colleagues. This module explores how these biases manifest and equip us with tools to mitigate their influence, creating a learning environment where every individual feels seen, valued, and included."

          "Unconscious bias refers to the automatic judgments or stereotypes that influence how we view and treat others. These biases are shaped by past experiences, cultural norms, and social influences. Crucially, unconscious bias is not something we are fully aware of, which is why it can be so pervasive.",
          "Imagine a classroom where you find yourself naturally gravitating toward students who share similar hobbies or backgrounds, or an office where certain colleagues seem to receive more support or recognition. These subtle preferences are not always intentional but can impact fairness and equality in ways that aren’t immediately visible.",
          "Studies confirm that unconscious biases are widespread, with one Harvard study revealing that 75% of participants exhibited biases in areas such as race, gender, and age, without even realizing it (Project Implicit, 2017). Understanding how these biases operate allows us to recognize their effects on decisions and behaviors, making it possible to challenge them."

A teacher might give more praise or opportunities to students who fit a certain stereotype of success, while others, perhaps those who are quieter or from different backgrounds, receive less support. Over time, these small, often unnoticed biases can lead to disparities in academic achievement.",
